                            <p>California Online Privacy Protection Act</p>
                            <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a<br />privacy policy. The law&apos;s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the<br />United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable<br />Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating<br />exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being<br />shared. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online- privacy-protection- act-<br />caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p>
                            <p>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:<br />Users can visit our site anonymously.<br />Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the<br />first significant page after entering our website.<br />Our Privacy Policy link includes the word &apos;Privacy&apos; and can easily be found on the page specified above.</p>

                            <p>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?<br />We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track<br />(DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p>
                            <p>5<br />Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?<br />It&apos;s also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral tracking</p>
                            <p>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</p>
                            <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the<br />Children&apos;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission,<br />United States&apos; consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators<br />of websites and online services must do to protect children&apos;s privacy and safety online.</p>
                            <p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.<br />Do we let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins collect PII from children under 13?</p>
                            <p>Fair Information Practices</p>
                            <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the<br />concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around<br />the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented<br />is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>
                            <p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should<br />a data breach occur:<br />We will notify you via email<br />&bull; Within 7 business days<br />We will notify the users via in-site notification<br />&bull; Within 7 business days</p>
                            <p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally<br />pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This<br />principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that<br />individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-<br />compliance by data processors.</p>
